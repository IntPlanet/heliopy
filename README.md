*heliopy is in hibernation*

This means I (David Stansby) won't be reviewing or adding any new functionality
(unless it's helpful for my own research). I'll still review (and hopefully merge)
bug fixes. If you're interested in taking over the heliopy project, drop me an
email. Otherwise, see https://www.davidstansby.com/2020/12/04/heliopy-udpate.html for more info.

---------------------------------

heliopy aims to provide a set of generic tools to work with 1D in-situ timeseries measurements of space plasmas.

Full documentation can be found [here](http://docs.heliopy.org/).
